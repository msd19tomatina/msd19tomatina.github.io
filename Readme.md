Assignment for the subject mobile platforms at FH JOANNEUM.<br>

Following the template provided by DI (FH) MSc Mathias Knoll.

#### What it does
The assignment was to make a PWA based on our prototypes made in the previous mobile platforms assignments.
Base idea is a Progressive Web Application that allows the user to track his learn sessions following the pomodoro
method. Our data to populate the pwa is retrieved from a local json file. At a later date it is planned to implement a 
database hosted on a live server to allow real tracking and user creation.

The artist Vanja Vikalo / LINNCH kindly allowed us to use his art for the launch screen and icons.
